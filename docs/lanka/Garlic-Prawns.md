# Garlic Prawns

## Ingredients

### GARLIC MARINADE FOR PRAWS:
* 500g / 1lb prawns (shrimp) , peeled and deveined, tail on 
* 4 garlic cloves , finely chopped (don't use crusher/mincer)
* 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil (separated)
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
### COOKING
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1.5 tbsp olive oil
* 50g / 3.5 tbsp unsalted butter , cut into 1.5cm / 1/2" cubes 
* 1/4 cup dry white wine (Note 3)
* 2 tbsp lemon juice
### SERVING
* 2 tbsp parsley, finely chopped (garnish)
* lemon wedges
* Bread for mopping!

## Instructions

### MARINADE
* Place the prawns, garlic, olive oil and pepper in bowl. Gently toss then set aside for 20 minutes.
* Salt: Add salt into prawns just before cooking and toss.
### COOKING
* Sear in batches: Heat oil and about 1/3 of the butter in a large heavy based fry pan over high heat. When the butter is melted, add half the prawns - don't crowd the pan.
* Cook for 1 minute until light golden then turn with tongs. Cook 1 minute then remove onto a plate. Cook the remaining prawns also for 1 minute each side (you shouldn't need more oil).
* Return first batch of prawns back into pan.
* Add wine - it will sizzle and be steamy! Stir, scraping the bottom of the pan, until wine mostly evaporates - around 30 seconds.
* Butter & lemon: Scatter remaining butter across pan, add lemon juice. After butter melts, stir for 30 seconds, then remove from stove.
* Garnish & serve: Transfer to serving plate, sprinkle with parsley and serve with extra lemon wedges. Bread for mopping is essential - try this simple.
